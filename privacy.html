    <p>Last updated: January 29, 2026</p>
    <p>QIV is committed to protecting your privacy. This page explains what information we collect and how it is used.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Cookies: We use a minimal cookie to store simple preferences (cookie consent, theme, notification choice). No tracking or analytics are included by default.</li>
      <li>Review submissions: The fake review form on the site is UX-only. Submissions are sent to a private admin endpoint or stored in the site's local storage for administrative access only.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>Collected information is used solely to improve the user experience: remembering consent and theme, and to provide the admin with user-submitted reviews (not published publicly).</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Images may be hosted via Cloudinary or other CDN providers. Those services may collect logs for serving images; refer to their privacy policies for details.</p>
